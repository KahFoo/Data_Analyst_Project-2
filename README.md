## COVID 19 Data Exploration Using SQL

## Project Description:

This capstone project involves importing the COVID-19 dataset obtained from OWID (Our World in Data) into a Prosgres SQL database, with the aim of gaining valuable insights into past and present cases, deaths, and the vaccinations related to COVID- 19.

Based on the analysis:

- In Figure 1, the top 5 countries with the highest number of infections are the United States, India, France, Germany and Brazil. However, the COVID-19 data for China remains obscured at the moment due to insufficient information and data regarding the cases in that country.

- Figure 2 illustrates that the United States, Brazil, and India are also among the top five countries with the highest number of fatalities. They are followed by Russia and Mexico.

- According to the death percentage depicted in Figure 3, Peru takes the lead in the top list, followed by Mexico, Brazil, Russia, and India.

- Figure 4 demonstrates that China is at the forefront in terms of total vaccinations, followed by India, the United States, Brazil, and Indonesia.


## Conclusions:

- The analysis reveals that the United States, India, and Brazil are among the countries with the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases, fatalities, and vaccinations.
- Some Latin American countries exhibit a higher fatality rate from COVID-19 in comparison to other nations.
